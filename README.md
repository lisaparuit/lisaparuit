My name is Lisa PARUIT, my pronouns are she/her.
I am interrested in mathematics, ecosystem biology and conservation ecology, especially population dynamics and biological interractions. 
I am currently a master's student at Ecole Polytechnique and AgroParisTech in France where I am learning mathematical modelling for life sciences with an emphasis on ecology and evolutionnary sciences.

I want to do research that matters. In order to do so, I want to use mathematical modelling and data sciences to better grasp how ecosystems work, how species interract and how we, humans, impact them.
